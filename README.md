# Interactive Physical Trainer Using Unity

This project focuses on the development of a "virtual physical trainer" using Unity as the main platform, aiming to provide a more convenient and engaging fitness experience compared to gym workouts. Some key features I have developed include: 
- a complete workout flow comprising warm-ups and workout exercises
- a guided experience with captioned instructions
- an indoor workout environment with decorations, furniture and background music
- a functional menu interface for navigation and settings adjustments

Some future improvements may include:
- real-time voice guidance
- speech recognition for user commands
- customized muscle group targeting
- personalized workout environments
